Introduction
This article describes how to use the GitHub REST API with GitHub CLI, curl, or JavaScript. For a quickstart guide, see "Quickstart for GitHub REST API."
About requests to the REST API
This section describes the elements that make up an API request:

HTTP method
Path
Headers
Media types
Authentication
Parameters

Every request to the REST API includes an HTTP method and a path. Depending on the REST API endpoint, you might also need to specify request headers, authentication information, query parameters, or body parameters.
The REST API reference documentation describes the HTTP method, path, and parameters for every endpoint. It also displays example requests and responses for each endpoint. For more information, see the REST reference documentation.
HTTP method
The HTTP method of an endpoint defines the type of action it performs on a given resource. Some common HTTP methods are GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH. The REST API reference documentation provides the HTTP method for every endpoint.
For example, the HTTP method for the "List repository issues" endpoint is GET."
Where possible, the GitHub REST API strives to use an appropriate HTTP method for each action.

GET: Used for retrieving resources.
POST: Used for creating resources.
PATCH: Used for updating properties of resources.
PUT: Used for replacing resources or collections of resources.
DELETE: Used for deleting resources.

Path
Each endpoint has a path. The REST API reference documentation gives the path for every endpoint. For example, the path for the "List repository issues" endpoint is /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues.
The curly brackets {} in a path denote path parameters that you need to specify. Path parameters modify the endpoint path and are required in your request. For example, the path parameters for the "List repository issues" endpoint are {owner} and {repo}. To use this path in your API request, replace {repo} with the name of the repository where you would like to request a list of issues, and replace {owner} with the name of the account that owns the repository.
Headers
Headers provide extra information about the request and the desired response. Following are some examples of headers that you can use in your requests to the GitHub REST API. For an example of a request that uses headers, see "Making a request."
Accept
Most GitHub REST API endpoints specify that you should pass an Accept header with a value of application/vnd.github+json. The value of the Accept header is a media type. For more information about media types, see "Media types."
X-GitHub-Api-Version
You should use this header to specify a version of the REST API to use for your request. For more information, see "API Versions."
User-Agent
All API requests must include a valid User-Agent header. The User-Agent header identifies the user or application that is making the request.

By default, GitHub CLI sends a valid User-Agent header. However,  GitHub recommends using your GitHub username, or the name of your application, for the User-Agent header value. This allows GitHub to contact you if there are problems.


By default, curl sends a valid User-Agent header. However GitHub recommends using your GitHub username, or the name of your application, for the User-Agent header value. This allows GitHub to contact you if there are problems.


If you use the Octokit.js SDK, the SDK will send a valid User-Agent header for you. However, GitHub recommends using your GitHub username, or the name of your application, for the User-Agent header value. This allows GitHub to contact you if there are problems.

The following is an example User-Agent for an app named Awesome-Octocat-App:
User-Agent: Awesome-Octocat-App

Requests with no User-Agent header will be rejected. If you provide an invalid User-Agent header, you will receive a 403 Forbidden response.

Media types
You can specify one or more media types by adding them to the Accept header of your request. For more information about the Accept header, see "Accept."
Media types specify the format of the data you want to consume from the API. Media types are specific to resources, allowing them to change independently and support formats that other resources don't. The documentation for each GitHub REST API endpoint will describe the media types that it supports. For more information, see the "GitHub REST API documentation."
The most common media types supported by the GitHub REST API are application/vnd.github+json and application/json.
There are custom media types that you can use with some endpoints. For example, the REST API to manage commits and pull requests support the media types diff, patch, and sha. The media types full, raw, text, or html are used by some other endpoints.
All custom media types for GitHub look like this: application/vnd.github.PARAM+json, where PARAM is the name of the media type. For example, to specify the raw media type, you would use application/vnd.github.raw+json.
For an example of a request that uses media types, see "Making a request."
Authentication
Many endpoints require authentication or return additional information if you are authenticated. Additionally, you can make more requests per hour when you are authenticated.

To authenticate your request, you will need to provide an authentication token with the required scopes or permissions. There a few different ways to get a token: You can create a personal access token, generate a token with a GitHub App, or use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN in a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see "Authenticating to the REST API."
For an example of a request that uses an authentication token, see "Making a request."

Note: If you don't want to create a token, you can use GitHub CLI. GitHub CLI will take care of authentication for you, and help keep your account secure. For more information, see the GitHub CLI version of this page.


Warning: Treat your access token the same way you would treat your passwords or other sensitive credentials. For more information, see "Keeping your API credentials secure."



Although some REST API endpoints are accessible without authentication, GitHub CLI requires you to authenticate before you can use the api subcommand to make an API request. Use the auth login subcommand to authenticate to GitHub. For more information, see "Making a request."


To authenticate your request, you will need to provide an authentication token with the required scopes or permissions. There a few different ways to get a token: You can create a personal access token, generate a token with a GitHub App, or use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN in a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see "Authenticating to the REST API."
For an example of a request that uses an authentication token, see "Making a request."

Warning: Treat your access token the same way you would treat your passwords or other sensitive credentials. For more information, see "Keeping your API credentials secure."


Parameters
Many API methods require or allow you to send additional information in parameters in your request. There are a few different types of parameters: Path parameters, body parameters, and query parameters.
Path parameters
Path parameters modify the endpoint path. These parameters are required in your request. For more information, see "Path."
Body parameters
Body parameters allow you to pass additional data to the API. These parameters can be optional or required, depending on the endpoint. For example, a body parameter may allow you to specify an issue title when creating a new issue, or specify certain settings when enabling or disabling a feature. The documentation for each GitHub REST API endpoint will describe the body parameters that it supports. For more information, see the "GitHub REST API documentation."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint requires that you specify a title for the new issue in your request. It also allows you to optionally specify other information, such as text to put in the issue body, users to assign to the new issue, or labels to apply to the new issue. For an example of a request that uses body parameters, see "Making a request."
You must authenticate your request to pass body parameters. For more information, see "Authenticating."
Query parameters
Query parameters allow you to control what data is returned for a request. These parameters are usually optional. The documentation for each GitHub REST API endpoint will describe any query parameters that it supports. For more information, see the "GitHub REST API documentation."
For example, the "List public events" endpoint returns thirty issues by default. You can use the per_page query parameter to return two issues instead of 30. You can use the page query parameter to fetch only the first page of results. For an example of a request that uses query parameters, see "Making a request."
Making a request

This section demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to the GitHub REST API using GitHub CLI.
1. Setup
Install GitHub CLI on macOS, Windows, or Linux. For more information, see Installation in the GitHub CLI repository.
2. Authenticate


Authenticate with GitHub by running this command from your terminal.
Shellgh auth login
gh auth login

You can use the --scopes option to specify what scopes you want. If you want to authenticate with a token that you created, you can use the --with-token option. For more information, see the GitHub CLI auth login documentation.


Follow the on-screen prompts.
GitHub CLI automatically stores your Git credentials for you when you choose HTTPS as your preferred protocol for Git operations and answer "yes" to the prompt asking if you would like to authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials. This can be useful as it allows you to use Git commands like git push and git pull without needing to set up a separate credential manager or use SSH.


3. Choose an endpoint for your request


Choose an endpoint to make a request to. You can explore GitHub's REST API documentation to discover endpoints that you can use to interact with GitHub.


Identify the HTTP method and path of the endpoint. You will send these with your request. For more information, see "HTTP method" and "Path."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the HTTP method POST and the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues.


Identify any required path parameters. Required path parameters appear in curly brackets {} in the path of the endpoint. Replace each parameter placeholder with the desired value. For more information, see "Path."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues, and the path parameters are {owner} and {repo}. To use this path in your API request, replace {repo} with the name of the repository where you would like to create a new issue, and replace {owner} with the name of the account that owns the repository.


4. Make a request with GitHub CLI
Use the GitHub CLI api subcommand to make your API request. For more information, see the GitHub CLI api documentation.
In your request, specify the following options and values:


--method followed by the HTTP method and the path of the endpoint. For more information, see "HTTP method" and "Path."


--header:

Accept: Pass the media type in an Accept header. To pass multiple media types in an Accept header, separate the media types with a comma: Accept: application/vnd.github+json,application/vnd.github.diff. For more information, see "Accept" and "Media types."
X-GitHub-Api-Version: Pass the API version in a X-GitHub-Api-Version header. For more information, see "X-GitHub-Api-Version."



-f or -F followed by any body parameters or query parameters in key=value format. Use the -F option to pass a parameter that is a number, Boolean, or null. Use the -f option to pass string parameters.
Some endpoints use query parameters that are arrays. To send an array in the query string, use the query parameter once per array item, and append [] after the query parameter name. For example, to provide an array of two repository IDs, use -f repository_ids[]=REPOSITORY_A_ID -f repository_ids[]=REPOSITORY_B_ID.
If you do not need to specify any body parameters or query parameters in your request, omit this option. For more information, see "Body parameters" and "Query parameters." For examples, see "Example request using body parameters" and "Example request using query parameters."


Example request
The following example request uses the "Get Octocat" endpoint to return the octocat as ASCII art.
Shellgh api --method GET /octocat \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
gh api --method GET /octocat \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"

Example request using query parameters
The "List public events" endpoint returns thirty issues by default. The following example uses the per_page query parameter to return two issues instead of 30, and the page query parameter to fetch only the first page of results.
Shellgh api --method GET /events -F per_page=2 -F page=1
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
gh api --method GET /events -F per_page=2 -F page=1
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \

Example request using body parameters
The following example uses the "Create an issue" endpoint to create a new issue in the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. In the response, find the html_url of your issue, and navigate to your issue in the browser.
Shellgh api --method POST /repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
-f title='Created with the REST API' \
-f body='This is a test issue created by the REST API' \
gh api --method POST /repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
-f title='Created with the REST API' \
-f body='This is a test issue created by the REST API' \



This section demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to the GitHub REST API using curl.
1. Setup
You must have curl installed on your machine. To check if curl is already installed, run curl --version on the command line.

If the output provides information about the version of curl, that means curl is installed.
If you get a message similar to command not found: curl, that means curl is not installed. Download and install curl. For more information, see the curl download page.

2. Choose an endpoint for your request


Choose an endpoint to make a request to. You can explore GitHub's REST API documentation to discover endpoints that you can use to interact with GitHub.


Identify the HTTP method and path of the endpoint. You will send these with your request. For more information, see "HTTP method" and "Path."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the HTTP method POST and the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues.


Identify any required path parameters. Required path parameters appear in curly brackets {} in the path of the endpoint. Replace each parameter placeholder with the desired value. For more information, see "Path."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues, and the path parameters are {owner} and {repo}. To use this path in your API request, replace {repo} with the name of the repository where you would like to create a new issue, and replace {owner} with the name of the account that owns the repository.


3. Create authentication credentials
Create an access token to authenticate your request. You can save your token and use it for multiple requests. Give the token any scopes or permissions that are required to access the endpoint. You will send this token in an Authorization header with your request. For more information, see "Authentication."
4. Make a curl request
Use the curl command to make your request. For more information, see the curl documentation.
Specify the following options and values in your request:


--request or -X followed by the HTTP method as the value. For more information, see "HTTP method."


--url followed by the full path as the value. The full path is a URL that includes the base URL for the GitHub REST API (https://api.github.com) and the path of the endpoint, like this: https://api.github.com/PATH. Replace PATH with the path of the endpoint. For more information, see "Path."
To use query parameters, add a ? to the end of the path, then append your query parameter name and value in the form parameter_name=value. Separate multiple query parameters with &. If you need to send an array in the query string, use the query parameter once per array item, and append [] after the query parameter name. For example, to provide an array of two repository IDs, use ?repository_ids[]=REPOSITORY_A_ID&repository_ids[]=REPOSITORY_B_ID. For more information, see "Query parameters." For an example, see "Example request using query parameters."


--header or -H:

Accept: Pass the media type in an Accept header. To pass multiple media types in an Accept header, separate the media types with a comma, for example: Accept: application/vnd.github+json,application/vnd.github.diff. For more information, see "Accept" and "Media types."
X-GitHub-Api-Version: Pass the API version in a X-GitHub-Api-Version header. For more information, see "X-GitHub-Api-Version."
Authorization: Pass your authentication token in an Authorization header. Note that in most cases you can use Authorization: Bearer or Authorization: token to pass a token. However, if you are passing a JSON web token (JWT), you must use Authorization: Bearer. For more information, see "Authentication." For an example of a request that uses an Authorization header, see "Example request using body parameters."



--data or -d followed by any body parameters within a JSON object. If you do not need to specify any body parameters in your request, omit this option. For more information, see "Body parameters." For an example, see "Example request using body parameters."


Example request
The following example request uses the "Get Octocat" endpoint to return the octocat as ASCII art.
Shellcurl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/octocat" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/octocat" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"

Example request using query parameters
The "List public events" endpoint returns thirty issues by default. The following example uses the per_page query parameter to return two issues instead of 30, and the page query parameter to fetch only the first page of results.
Shellcurl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/events?per_page=2&page=1" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/events
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/events?per_page=2&page=1" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/events

Example request using body parameters
The following example uses the "Create an issue" endpoint to create a new issue in the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. Replace YOUR-TOKEN with the authentication token you created in a previous step.

Note: If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, you must replace octocat/Spoon-Knife with a repository that you own or that is owned by an organization that you are a member of. Your token must have access to that repository and have read and write permissions for repository issues. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens."

Shellcurl \
--request POST \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--data '{
  "title": "Created with the REST API",
  "body": "This is a test issue created by the REST API"
}'
curl \
--request POST \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--data '{
  "title": "Created with the REST API",
  "body": "This is a test issue created by the REST API"
}'



This section demonstrates how to make a request to the GitHub REST API using JavaScript and Octokit.js. For a more detailed guide, see "Scripting with the REST API and JavaScript."
1. Setup
You must install octokit to use the Octokit.js library shown in the following examples.

Install octokit. For example, npm install octokit. For other ways to install or load octokit, see the Octokit.js README.

2. Choose an endpoint for your request


Choose an endpoint to make a request to. You can explore GitHub's REST API documentation to discover endpoints that you can use to interact with GitHub.


Identify the HTTP method and path of the endpoint. You will send these with your request. For more information, see "HTTP method" and "Path."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the HTTP method POST and the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues.


Identify any required path parameters. Required path parameters appear in curly brackets {} in the path of the endpoint. Replace each parameter placeholder with the desired value. For more information, see "Path."
For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues, and the path parameters are {owner} and {repo}. To use this path in your API request, replace {repo} with the name of the repository where you would like to create a new issue, and replace {owner} with the name of the account that owns the repository.


3. Create an access token
Create an access token to authenticate your request. You can save your token and use it for multiple requests. Give the token any scopes or permissions that are required to access the endpoint. You will send this token in an Authorization header with your request. For more information, see "Authentication."
4. Make a request with Octokit.js


Import octokit in your script. For example, import { Octokit } from "octokit";. For other ways to import octokit, see the Octokit.js README.


Create an instance of Octokit with your token. Replace YOUR-TOKEN with your token.
JavaScriptconst octokit = new Octokit({ 
  auth: 'YOUR-TOKEN'
});
const octokit = new Octokit({ 
  auth: 'YOUR-TOKEN'
});



Use octokit.request to execute your request.

Send the HTTP method and path as the first argument to the request method. For more information, see "HTTP method" and "Path."
Specify all path, query, and body parameters in an object as the second argument to the request method. For more information, see "Parameters."

In the following example request, the HTTP method is POST, the path is /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues, the path parameters are owner: "octocat" and repo: "Spoon-Knife", and the body parameters are title: "Created with the REST API" and body: "This is a test issue created by the REST API".

Note: If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, you must replace octocat/Spoon-Knife with a repository that you own or that is owned by an organization that you are a member of. Your token must have access to that repository and have read and write permissions for repository issues. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens."

JavaScriptawait octokit.request("POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
  owner: "octocat",
  repo: "Spoon-Knife",
  title: "Created with the REST API",
  body: "This is a test issue created by the REST API",
});
await octokit.request("POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
  owner: "octocat",
  repo: "Spoon-Knife",
  title: "Created with the REST API",
  body: "This is a test issue created by the REST API",
});

The request method automatically passes the Accept: application/vnd.github+json header. To pass additional headers or a different Accept header, add a headers property to the object that is passed as a second argument. The value of the headers property is an object with the header names as keys and header values as values.
For example, the following code will send a content-type header with a value of text/plain and a X-GitHub-Api-Version header with a value of 2022-11-28.
JavaScriptawait octokit.request("GET /octocat", {
  headers: {
    "content-type": "text/plain",
    "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
  },
});
await octokit.request("GET /octocat", {
  headers: {
    "content-type": "text/plain",
    "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
  },
});




Using the response
After you make a request, the API will return the response status code, response headers, and potentially a response body.
About the response code and headers
Every request will return an HTTP status code that indicates the success of the response. For more information about response codes, see the MDN HTTP response status code documentation.
Additionally, the response will include headers that give more details about the response. Headers that start with X- or x- are custom to GitHub. For example, the x-ratelimit-remaining and x-ratelimit-reset headers tell you how many requests you can make in a time period.

To view the status code and headers, use the --include or --i option when you send your request.
For example, this request gets a list of issues in the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository:
gh api \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
--method GET /repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues \
-F per_page=2 --include

And it returns a response code and headers that look something like this:
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, Location, Retry-After, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Used, X-RateLimit-Resource, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval, X-GitHub-Media-Type, X-GitHub-SSO, X-GitHub-Request-Id, Deprecation, Sunset

X-Ratelimit-Reset: 1659645499
X-Ratelimit-Resource: core
X-Ratelimit-Used: 4
X-Xss-Protection: 0

In this example, the response code is 200, which indicates a successful request.


When you make a request with Octokit.js, the request method returns a promise. If the request was successful, the promise resolves to an object that includes the HTTP status code of the response (status) and the response headers (headers). If an error occurs, the promise resolves to an object that includes the HTTP status code of the response (status) and the response headers (response.headers).
You can use a try/catch block to catch an error if it occurs. For example, if the request in the following script is successful, the script will log the status code and the value of the x-ratelimit-remaining header. If the request was not successful, the script will log the status code, the value of the x-ratelimit-remaining header, and the error message.
In the following example, replace REPO-OWNER with the name of the account that owns the repository, and REPO-NAME with the name of the repository.
JavaScripttry {
  const result = await octokit.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
    owner: "REPO-OWNER",
    repo: "REPO-NAME",
    per_page: 2,
  });

  console.log(`Success! Status: ${result.status}. Rate limit remaining: ${result.headers["x-ratelimit-remaining"]}`)

} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error! Status: ${error.status}. Rate limit remaining: ${error.headers["x-ratelimit-remaining"]}. Message: ${error.response.data.message}`)
}
try {
  const result = await octokit.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
    owner: "REPO-OWNER",
    repo: "REPO-NAME",
    per_page: 2,
  });

  console.log(`Success! Status: ${result.status}. Rate limit remaining: ${result.headers["x-ratelimit-remaining"]}`)

} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error! Status: ${error.status}. Rate limit remaining: ${error.headers["x-ratelimit-remaining"]}. Message: ${error.response.data.message}`)
}



To view the status code and headers, use the --include or --i option when you send your request.
For example, this request gets a list of issues in the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository:
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues?per_page=2" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--include

And it returns a response code and headers that look something like this:

In this example, the response code is 200, which indicates a successful request.

About the response body
Many endpoints will return a response body. Unless otherwise specified, the response body is in JSON format. Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted. All timestamps return in UTC time, ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.
Unlike the GraphQL API where you specify what information you want, the REST API typically returns more information than you need. If desired, you can parse the response to pull out specific pieces of information.

For example, you can use > to redirect the response to a file. In the following example, replace REPO-OWNER with the name of the account that owns the repository, and REPO-NAME with the name of the repository.
Shellgh api \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
--method GET /repos/REPO-OWNER/REPO-NAME/issues \
-F per_page=2 > data.json
gh api \
--header 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
--method GET /repos/REPO-OWNER/REPO-NAME/issues \
-F per_page=2 > data.json

Then you can use jq to get the title and author ID of each issue:
Shelljq '.[] | {title: .title, authorID: .user.id}' data.json
jq '.[] | {title: .title, authorID: .user.id}' data.json

The previous two commands return something like:
{
  "title": "Update index.html",
  "authorID": 10701255
}
{
  "title": "Edit index file",
  "authorID": 53709285
}

For more information about jq, see the jq documentation.


For example, you can get the title and author ID of each issue. In the following example, replace REPO-OWNER with the name of the account that owns the repository, and REPO-NAME with the name of the repository.
JavaScripttry {
  const result = await octokit.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
    owner: "REPO-OWNER",
    repo: "REPO-NAME",
    per_page: 2,
  });

  const titleAndAuthor = result.data.map(issue => {title: issue.title, authorID: issue.user.id})

  console.log(titleAndAuthor)

} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error! Status: ${error.status}. Message: ${error.response.data.message}`)
}
try {
  const result = await octokit.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
    owner: "REPO-OWNER",
    repo: "REPO-NAME",
    per_page: 2,
  });

  const titleAndAuthor = result.data.map(issue => {title: issue.title, authorID: issue.user.id})

  console.log(titleAndAuthor)

} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Error! Status: ${error.status}. Message: ${error.response.data.message}`)
}



For example, you can use > to redirect the response to a file. In the following example, replace REPO-OWNER with the name of the account that owns the repository, and REPO-NAME with the name of the repository.
Shellcurl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/REPO-OWNER/REPO-NAME/issues?per_page=2" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" > data.json
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/REPO-OWNER/REPO-NAME/issues?per_page=2" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" > data.json

Then you can use jq to get the title and author ID of each issue:
Shelljq '.[] | {title: .title, authorID: .user.id}' data.json
jq '.[] | {title: .title, authorID: .user.id}' data.json

The previous two commands return something like:
{
  "title": "Update index.html",
  "authorID": 10701255
}
{
  "title": "Edit index file",
  "authorID": 53709285
}

For more information about jq, see the jq documentation.

Detailed versus summary representations
A response can include all attributes for a resource or only a subset of attributes, depending on whether you fetch an individual resource or a list of resources.

When you fetch an individual resource, like a specific repository, the response will typically include all attributes for that resource. This is the "detailed" representation of the resource.
When you fetch a list of resources, like a list of multiple repositories, the response will only include a subset of the attributes for each resource. This is the "summary" representation of the resource.

Note that authorization sometimes influences the amount of detail included in a representation.
The reason for this is because some attributes are computationally expensive for the API to provide, so GitHub excludes those attributes from the summary representation. To obtain those attributes, you can fetch the detailed representation.
The documentation provides an example response for each API method. The example response illustrates all attributes that are returned by that method.
Hypermedia
All resources may have one or more *_url properties linking to other resources. These are meant to provide explicit URLs so that proper API clients don't need to construct URLs on their own.  It is highly recommended that API clients use these. Doing so will make future upgrades of the API easier for developers. All URLs are expected to be proper RFC 6570 URI templates.
You can then expand these templates using something like the uri_template gem:
>> tmpl = URITemplate.new('/notifications{?since,all,participating}')
>> tmpl.expand
=> "/notifications"

>> tmpl.expand all: 1
=> "/notifications?all=1"

>> tmpl.expand all: 1, participating: 1
=> "/notifications?all=1&participating=1"

Next steps
This article demonstrated how to list and create issues in a repository. For more practice, try to comment on an issue, edit the title of an issue, or close an issue. For more information, see the "Create an issue comment" endpoint and the "Update an issue" endpoint.
For more information about other endpoints that you can use, see the REST reference documentation.About primary rate limits
GitHub limits the number of REST API requests that you can make within a specific amount of time. This limit helps prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, and ensures that the API remains available for all users.
Some endpoints, like the search endpoints, have more restrictive limits. For more information about these endpoints, see "REST API endpoints for rate limits." The GraphQL API also has a separate primary rate limit. For more information, see "Rate limits and node limits for the GraphQL API."
In general, you can calculate your primary rate limit for the REST API based on your method of authentication, as described below.
Primary rate limit for unauthenticated users
You can make unauthenticated requests if you are only fetching public data. Unauthenticated requests are associated with the originating IP address, not with the user or application that made the request.
The primary rate limit for unauthenticated requests is 60 requests per hour.
Primary rate limit for authenticated users
You can use a personal access token to make API requests. Additionally, you can authorize a GitHub App or OAuth app, which can then make API requests on your behalf.
All of these requests count towards your personal rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour. Requests made on your behalf by a GitHub App that is owned by a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization have a higher rate limit of 15,000 requests per hour. Similarly, requests made on your behalf by a OAuth app that is owned or approved by a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization have a higher rate limit of 15,000 requests per hour if you are a member of the GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization.
Primary rate limit for GitHub App installations
GitHub Apps authenticating with an installation access token use the installation's minimum rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour. If the installation is on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization, the installation has a rate limit of 15,000 requests per hour.
For installations that are not on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization, the rate limit for the installation will scale with the number of users and repositories. Installations that have more than 20 repositories receive another 50 requests per hour for each repository. Installations that are on an organization that have more than 20 users receive another 50 requests per hour for each user. The rate limit cannot increase beyond 12,500 requests per hour.
Primary rate limits for GitHub App user access tokens (as opposed to installation access tokens) are dictated by the primary rate limits for the authenticated user. This rate limit is combined with any requests that another GitHub App or OAuth app makes on that user's behalf and any requests that the user makes with a personal access token. For more information, see "Primary rate limit for authenticated users."
Primary rate limit for OAuth apps
Primary rate limits for OAuth access tokens generated by a OAuth app are dictated by the primary rate limits for authenticated users. This rate limit is combined with any requests that another GitHub App or OAuth app makes on that user's behalf and any requests that the user makes with a personal access token. For more information, see "Primary rate limit for authenticated users."
OAuth apps can also use their client ID and client secret to fetch public data. For example:
curl -u YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET -I https://api.github.com/meta

For these requests, the rate limit is 5,000 requests per hour per OAuth app. If the app is owned by a GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization, the rate limit is 15,000 requests per hour.

Note: Never include your app's client secret in client-side code or in code that runs on a user device. The client secret can be used to generate OAuth access tokens for users who have authorized your app, so you should always keep the client secret secure.

Primary rate limit for GITHUB_TOKEN in GitHub Actions
You can use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate requests in GitHub Actions workflows. For more information, see "Automatic token authentication."
The rate limit for GITHUB_TOKEN is 1,000 requests per hour per repository. For requests to resources that belong to a GitHub Enterprise Cloud account, the limit is 15,000 requests per hour per repository.
About secondary rate limits
In addition to primary rate limits, GitHub enforces secondary rate limits in order to prevent abuse and keep the API available for all users.
You may encounter a secondary rate limit if you:

Make too many concurrent requests. No more than 100 concurrent requests are allowed. This limit is shared across the REST API and GraphQL API.
Make too many requests to a single endpoint per minute. No more than 900 points per minute are allowed for REST API endpoints, and no more than 2,000 points per minute are allowed for the GraphQL API endpoint. For more information about points, see "Calculating points for the secondary rate limit."
Make too many requests per minute. No more than 90 seconds of CPU time per 60 seconds of real time is allowed. No more than 60 seconds of this CPU time may be for the GraphQL API. You can roughly estimate the CPU time by measuring the total response time for your API requests.
Create too much content on GitHub in a short amount of time. In general, no more than 80 content-generating requests per minute and no more than 500 content-generating requests per hour are allowed. Some endpoints have lower content creation limits. Content creation limits include actions taken on the GitHub web interface as well as via the REST API and GraphQL API.

These secondary rate limits are subject to change without notice. You may also encounter a secondary rate limit for undisclosed reasons.
Calculating points for the secondary rate limit
Some secondary rate limits are determined by the point values of requests. For GraphQL requests, these point values are separate from the point value calculations for the primary rate limit.
RequestPointsGraphQL requests without mutations1GraphQL requests with mutations5Most REST API GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests1Most REST API POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE  requests5
Some REST API endpoints have a different point cost that is not shared publicly.
Checking the status of your rate limit
You can use the headers that are sent with each response to determine the current status of your primary rate limit.
Header nameDescriptionx-ratelimit-limitThe maximum number of requests that you can make per hourx-ratelimit-remainingThe number of requests remaining in the current rate limit windowx-ratelimit-usedThe number of requests you have made in the current rate limit windowx-ratelimit-resetThe time at which the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch secondsx-ratelimit-resourceThe rate limit resource that the request counted against. For more information about the different resources, see "REST API endpoints for rate limits."
You can also call the GET /rate_limit endpoint to check your rate limit. Calling this endpoint does not count against your primary rate limit, but it can count against your secondary rate limit. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for rate limits." When possible, you should use the rate limit response headers instead of calling the API to check your rate limit.
There is not a way to check the status of your secondary rate limit.
Exceeding the rate limit
If you exceed your primary rate limit, you will receive a 403 or 429 response, and the x-ratelimit-remaining header will be 0. You should not retry your request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header.
If you exceed a secondary rate limit, you will receive a 403 or 429 response and an error message that indicates that you exceeded a secondary rate limit. If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed. If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not retry your request until after the time, in UTC epoch seconds, specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.
Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.
Staying under the rate limit
You should follow best practices to help you stay under the rate limits. For more information, see "Best practices for using the REST API."
Getting a higher rate limit
If you want a higher primary rate limit, consider making authenticated requests instead of unauthenticated requests. Authenticated requests have a significantly higher rate limit than unauthenticated requests.
If you are using a personal access token for automation in your organization, consider whether a GitHub App will work instead. The rate limit for GitHub Apps using an installation access token scales with the number of repositories and number of organization users. For more information, see "About creating GitHub Apps."
If you are using GitHub Apps or OAuth apps, consider upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Cloud. GitHub Apps or OAuth apps have higher rate limits for organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud.About pagination
When a response from the REST API would include many results, GitHub will paginate the results and return a subset of the results. For example, GET /repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues will only return 30 issues from the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository even though the repository includes over 1600 open issues. This makes the response easier to handle for servers and for people.
You can use the link header from the response to request additional pages of data. If an endpoint supports the per_page query parameter, you can control how many results are returned on a page.
This article demonstrates how to request additional pages of results for paginated responses, how to change the number of results returned on each page, and how to write a script to fetch multiple pages of results.
Using link headers
When a response is paginated, the response headers will include a link header. If the endpoint does not support pagination, or if all results fit on a single page, the link header will be omitted.
The link header contains URLs that you can use to fetch additional pages of results. For example, the previous, next, first, and last page of results.
To see the response headers for a particular endpoint, you can use curl, GitHub CLI, or a library you're using to make requests. To see the response headers if you are using a library to make requests, follow the documentation for that library. To see the response headers if you are using curl or GitHub CLI, pass the --include flag with your request. For example:
curl --include --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"

If the response is paginated, the link header will look something like this:
link: <https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?page=2>; rel="prev", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?page=4>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?page=515>; rel="last", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?page=1>; rel="first"

The link header provides the URL for the previous, next, first, and last page of results:

The URL for the previous page is followed by rel="prev".
The URL for the next page is followed by rel="next".
The URL for the last page is followed by rel="last".
The URL for the first page is followed by rel="first".

In some cases, only a subset of these links are available. For example, the link to the previous page won't be included if you are on the first page of results, and the link to the last page won't be included if it can't be calculated.
You can use the URLs from the link header to request another page of results. For example, to request the last page of results based on the previous example:
curl --include --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?page=515" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"

The URLs in the link header use query parameters to indicate which page of results to return. The query parameters in the link URLs may differ between endpoints, however each paginated endpoint will use the page, before/after, or since query parameters. (Some endpoints use the since parameter for something other than pagination.) In all cases, you can use the URLs in the link header to fetch additional pages of results. For more information about query parameters see "Getting started with the REST API."
Changing the number of items per page
If an endpoint supports the per_page query parameter, then you can control how many results are returned on a page. For more information about query parameters see "Getting started with the REST API."
For example, this request uses the per_page query parameter to return two items per page:
curl --include --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues?per_page=2" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"

The per_page parameter will automatically be included in the link header. For example:
link: <https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?per_page=2&page=2>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/repositories/1300192/issues?per_page=2&page=7715>; rel="last"

Scripting with pagination
Instead of manually copying URLs from the link header, you can write a script to fetch multiple pages of results.
The following examples use JavaScript and GitHub's Octokit.js library. For more information about Octokit.js, see "Getting started with the REST API" and the Octokit.js README.
Example using the Octokit.js pagination method
To fetch paginated results with Octokit.js, you can use octokit.paginate(). octokit.paginate() will fetch the next page of results until it reaches the last page and then return all of the results as a single array. A few endpoints return paginated results as array in an object, as opposed to returning the paginated results as an array. octokit.paginate() always returns an array of items even if the raw result was an object.
For example, this script gets all of the issues from the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. Although it requests 100 issues at a time, the function won't return until the last page of data is reached.
JavaScriptimport { Octokit } from "octokit";

const octokit = new Octokit({ });

const data = await octokit.paginate("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
  owner: "octocat",
  repo: "Spoon-Knife",
  per_page: 100,
  headers: {
    "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
  },
});

console.log(data)
import { Octokit } from "octokit";

const octokit = new Octokit({ });

const data = await octokit.paginate("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
  owner: "octocat",
  repo: "Spoon-Knife",
  per_page: 100,
  headers: {
    "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
  },
});

console.log(data)

You can pass an optional map function to octokit.paginate() to end pagination before the last page is reached or to reduce memory usage by keeping only a subset of the response. You can also use octokit.paginate.iterator() to iterate through a single page at a time instead of requesting every page. For more information, see the Octokit.js documentation.
Example creating a pagination method
If you are using another language or library that doesn't have a pagination method, you can build your own pagination method. This example still uses the Octokit.js library to make requests, but does not rely on octokit.paginate().
The getPaginatedData function makes a request to an endpoint with octokit.request(). The data from the response is processed by parseData, which handles cases where no data is returned or cases where the data that is returned is an object instead of an array. The processed data is then appended to a list that contains all of the paginated data collected so far. If the response includes a link header and if the link header includes a link for the next page, then the function uses a RegEx pattern (nextPattern) to get the URL for the next page. The function then repeats the previous steps, now using this new URL. Once the link header no longer includes a link to the next page, all of the results are returned.
JavaScriptimport { Octokit } from "octokit";

const octokit = new Octokit({ });

async function getPaginatedData(url) {
  const nextPattern = /(?<=<)([\S]*)(?=>; rel="Next")/i;
  let pagesRemaining = true;
  let data = [];

  while (pagesRemaining) {
    const response = await octokit.request(`GET ${url}`, {
      per_page: 100,
      headers: {
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version":
          "2022-11-28",
      },
    });

    const parsedData = parseData(response.data)
    data = [...data, ...parsedData];

    const linkHeader = response.headers.link;

    pagesRemaining = linkHeader && linkHeader.includes(`rel=\"next\"`);

    if (pagesRemaining) {
      url = linkHeader.match(nextPattern)[0];
    }
  }

  return data;
}

function parseData(data) {
  // If the data is an array, return that
    if (Array.isArray(data)) {
      return data
    }

  // Some endpoints respond with 204 No Content instead of empty array
  //   when there is no data. In that case, return an empty array.
  if (!data) {
    return []
  }

  // Otherwise, the array of items that we want is in an object
  // Delete keys that don't include the array of items
  delete data.incomplete_results;
  delete data.repository_selection;
  delete data.total_count;
  // Pull out the array of items
  const namespaceKey = Object.keys(data)[0];
  data = data[namespaceKey];

  return data;
}

const data = await getPaginatedData("/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues");

console.log(data);
import { Octokit } from "octokit";

const octokit = new Octokit({ });

async function getPaginatedData(url) {
  const nextPattern = /(?<=<)([\S]*)(?=>; rel="Next")/i;
  let pagesRemaining = true;
  let data = [];

  while (pagesRemaining) {
    const response = await octokit.request(`GET ${url}`, {
      per_page: 100,
      headers: {
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version":
          "2022-11-28",
      },
    });

    const parsedData = parseData(response.data)
    data = [...data, ...parsedData];

    const linkHeader = response.headers.link;

    pagesRemaining = linkHeader && linkHeader.includes(`rel=\"next\"`);

    if (pagesRemaining) {
      url = linkHeader.match(nextPattern)[0];
    }
  }

  return data;
}

function parseData(data) {
  // If the data is an array, return that
    if (Array.isArray(data)) {
      return data
    }

  // Some endpoints respond with 204 No Content instead of empty array
  //   when there is no data. In that case, return an empty array.
  if (!data) {
    return []
  }

  // Otherwise, the array of items that we want is in an object
  // Delete keys that don't include the array of items
  delete data.incomplete_results;
  delete data.repository_selection;
  delete data.total_count;
  // Pull out the array of items
  const namespaceKey = Object.keys(data)[0];
  data = data[namespaceKey];

  return data;
}

const data = await getPaginatedData("/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues");

console.log(data);
About libraries
You can use libraries to extend and simplify the way your application interacts with GitHub's API. Each library provides pre-built code for a specific programming language. After integrating a library into your project, you can use the pre-built code modules to interact with GitHub's API via a specific programming language.
GitHub maintains official Octokit libraries for some languages. There are also third-party libraries that you can use with GitHub's API, which are not maintained by GitHub.

Avoid polling
You should subscribe to webhook events instead of polling the API for data. This will help your integration stay within the API rate limit. For more information, see "Webhooks documentation."
Make authenticated requests
Authenticated requests have a higher primary rate limit than unauthenticated requests. To avoid exceeding the rate limit, you should make authenticated requests. For more information, see "Rate limits for the REST API."
Avoid concurrent requests
To avoid exceeding secondary rate limits, you should make requests serially instead of concurrently. To achieve this, you can implement a queue system for requests.
Pause between mutative requests
If you are making a large number of POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE requests, wait at least one second between each request. This will help you avoid secondary rate limits.
Handle rate limit errors appropriately
If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily according to these guidelines:

If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not make another request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. The x-ratelimit-reset header is in UTC epoch seconds.
Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.

Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.
Follow redirects
The GitHub REST API uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. You should assume that any
request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is not an error, and you should follow the redirect.
A 301 status code indicates permanent redirection. You should repeat your request to the URL specified by the location header. Additionally, you should update your code to use this URL for future requests.
A 302 or 307 status code indicates temporary redirection. You should repeat your request to the URL specified by the location header. However, you should not update your code to use this URL for future requests.
Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with HTTP specifications.
Do not manually parse URLs
Many API endpoints return URL values for fields in the response body. You should not try to parse these URLs or to predict the structure of future URLs. This can cause your integration to break if GitHub changes the structure of the URL in the future. Instead, you should look for a field that contains the information that you need. For example, the endpoint to create an issue returns an html_url field with a value like https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/issues/1347 and a number field with a value like 1347. If you need to know the number of the issue, use the number field instead of parsing the html_url field.
Similarly, you should not try to manually construct pagination queries. Instead, you should use the link headers to determine what pages of results you can request. For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
Use conditional requests if appropriate
Most endpoints return an etag header, and many endpoints return a last-modified header. You can use the values of these headers to make conditional requests. If the response has not changed, you will receive a 304 Not Modified response. Making a conditional request does not count against your primary rate limit if a 304 response is returned.
For example, if a previous request returned an etag header value of 644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730, you can use the if-none-match header in a future request:
curl https://api.github.com/meta --include --header 'if-none-match: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"'

For example, if a previous request returned a last-modified header value of Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:17:59 GMT, you can use the if-modified-since header in a future request:
curl https://api.github.com/repos/github/docs --include --header 'if-modified-since: Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:17:59 GMT'

Do not ignore errors
You should not ignore repeated 4xx and 5xx error codes. Instead, you should ensure that you are correctly interacting with the API. For example, if an endpoint requests a string and you are passing it a numeric value, you will receive a validation error. Similarly, attempting to access an unauthorized or nonexistent endpoint will result in a 4xx error.
Intentionally ignoring repeated validation errors may result in the suspension of your app for abuse.

Rate limit errors
GitHub enforces rate limits to ensure that the API stays available for all users. For more information, see "Rate limits for the REST API."
If you exceed your primary rate limit, you will receive a 403 Forbidden or 429 Too Many Requests  response, and the x-ratelimit-remaining header will be 0. If you exceed a secondary rate limit, you will receive a 403 Forbidden or 429 Too Many Requests  response and an error message that indicates that you exceeded a secondary rate limit.
If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily according to these guidelines:

If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not make another request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. The x-ratelimit-reset header is in UTC epoch seconds.
Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.

Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.
For more information about how to avoid exceeding the rate limits, see "Best practices for using the REST API."
404 Not Found for an existing resource
If you make a request to access a private resource and your request isn't properly authenticated, you will receive a 404 Not Found response. GitHub uses a 404 Not Found response instead of a 403 Forbidden response to avoid confirming the existence of private repositories.
If you get a 404 Not Found response when you know that the resource that you are requesting exists, you should check your authentication. For example:

If you are using a personal access token (classic), you should ensure that:

The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, see "Scopes for OAuth apps" and "Managing your personal access tokens."
The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see "Token expiration and revocation."


If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, you should ensure that:

The token has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
The resource owner that was specified for the token matches the owner of the resource that the endpoint will affect. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens."
The token has access to any private repositories that the endpoint will affect. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens."
The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see "Token expiration and revocation."


If you are using a GitHub App installation access token, you should ensure that:

The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the account where the GitHub App is installed.
The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see "Token expiration and revocation."


If you are using a GitHub App user access token, you should ensure that:

The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
The user has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
The user has approved any updated permissions for your GitHub App. For more information, see "Approving updated permissions for a GitHub App."


If you are using an OAuth app user access token, you should ensure that:

The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, see "Scopes for OAuth apps."
The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The organization has not blocked OAuth app access, if you are using an endpoint that will affect resources owned by an organization. App owners cannot see whether their app is blocked, but they can instruct users of the app to check this. For more information, see "About OAuth app access restrictions."
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see "Token expiration and revocation."


If you are using GITHUB_TOKEN in a GitHub Actions workflow, you should ensure that:

The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the repository where the workflow is running. If you need to access resources outside of that repository, such as resources owned by an organization or resources owned by another repository, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App.



For more information about authentication, see "Authenticating to the REST API."
You should also check for typos in your URL. For example, adding a trailing slash to the endpoint will result in a 404 Not Found. You can refer to the reference documentation for the endpoint to confirm that you have the correct URL.
Additionally, any path parameters must be URL encoded. For example, any slashes in the parameter value must be replaced with %2F. If you don't properly encode any slashes in the parameter name, the endpoint URL will be misinterpreted.
Missing results
Most endpoints that return a list of resources support pagination. For most of these endpoints, only the first 30 resources are returned by default. In order to see all of the resources, you need to paginate through the results. For more information, see "Using pagination in the REST API."
If you are using pagination correctly and still do not see all of the results that you expect, you should confirm that the authentication credentials that you used have access to all of the expected resources. For example, if you are using a GitHub App installation access token, if the installation was only granted access to a subset of repositories in an organization, any request for all repositories in that organization will return only the repositories that the app installation can access.
Requires authentication when using basic authentication
Basic authentication with your username and password is not supported. Instead, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App or OAuth app. For more information, see "Authenticating to the REST API."
Timeouts
If GitHub takes more than 10 seconds to process an API request, GitHub will terminate the request and you will receive a timeout response and a "Server Error" message.
GitHub reserves the right to change the timeout window to protect the speed and reliability of the API.
You can check the status of the REST API at githubstatus.com to determine whether the timeout is due to a problem with the API. You can also try to simplify your request or try your request later. For example, if you are requesting 100 items on a page, you can try requesting fewer items.
Resource not accessible
If you are using a GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token and you receive a "Resource not accessible by integration" or "Resource not accessible by personal access token" error, then your token has insufficient permissions. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
You can use the X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions header to identify the permissions that are required to access the REST API endpoint.
The value of the X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions header is a comma separated list of the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. Occasionally, you can choose from multiple permission sets. In these cases, multiple comma-separated lists will be separated by a semicolon.
For example:

X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: contents=read means that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs read access to the contents permission.
X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: pull_requests=write,contents=read means that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs write access to the pull request permission and read access to the contents permission.
X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: pull_requests=read,contents=read; issues=read,contents=read means that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs either read access to the pull request permission and read access to the contents permission, or read access to the issues permission and read access to the contents permission.

Problems parsing JSON
If you send invalid JSON in the request body, you may receive a 400 Bad Request response and a "Problems parsing JSON" error message. You can use a linter or JSON validator to help you identify errors in your JSON.
Body should be a JSON object
If the endpoint expects a JSON object and you do not format your request body as a JSON object, you may receive a 400 Bad Request response and a "Body should be a JSON object" error message.
Invalid request
If you omit required parameters or you use the wrong type for a parameter, you may receive a 422 Unprocessable Entity response and an "Invalid request" error message. For example, you will get this error if you specify a parameter value as an array but the endpoint is expecting a string. You can refer to the reference documentation for the endpoint to verify that you are using the correct parameter types and that you are including all of the required parameters.
Validation Failed
If your request could not be processed, you may receive a 422 Unprocessable Entity response and a "Validation Failed" error message. The response body will include an errors property, which includes a code property to help you diagnose the problem.
CodeDescriptionmissingA resource does not exist.missing_fieldA parameter that was required was not specified. Review the documentation for the endpoint to see what parameters are required.invalidThe formatting of a parameter is invalid. Review the endpoint documentation for more specific information.already_existsAnother resource has the same value as one of your parameters.  This can happen in resources that must have some unique key (such as label names).unprocessableThe parameters that were provided were invalid.customRefer to the message property to diagnose the error.
Not a supported version
You should use the X-GitHub-Api-Version header to specify an API version. For example:
curl --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version:2022-11-28" https://api.github.com/zen

If you specify a version that does not exist, you will receive a 400 Bad Request error and a message about the version not being supported.
For more information, see "API Versions."
User agent required
Requests without a valid User-Agent header will be rejected. You should use your username or the name of your application for the User-Agent value.
curl sends a valid User-Agent header by default.
Other errors
If you observe an error that is not addressed here, you should refer to the error message that the API gives you. Most error messages will provide a clue about what is wrong and a link to relevant documentation.
If you observe unexpected failures, you can use githubstatus.com or the GitHub status API to check for incidents affecting the API.

"Best practices for using the REST API"
"Troubleshooting webhooks"
"Best practices for creating a GitHub App"
Some requests that create new data, such as creating a new commit, allow you to provide timezone information when specifying or generating timestamps.
Note that these rules apply only to data passed to the API, not to data returned by the API. Timestamps returned by the API are in UTC time, ISO 8601 format.
Determining the timezone for a request
To determine timezone information for applicable API calls, we apply these rules in order of priority:

Explicitly providing an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information
Using the Time-Zone header
Using the last known timezone for the user
Defaulting to UTC without other timezone information

Explicitly providing an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information
For API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact timestamp. These timestamps look something like 2014-02-27T15:05:06+01:00.
An example of this is the API to manage commits. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for Git commits."
Using the Time-Zone header
It is possible to supply a Time-Zone header, which defines a timezone according to the list of names from the Olson database.
curl -H "Time-Zone: Europe/Amsterdam" -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/github-linguist/linguist/contents/new_file.md

This means that we generate a timestamp for the moment your API call is made, in the timezone this header defines.
For example, the API to manage contents generates a git commit for each addition or change, and it uses the current time as the timestamp. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for repository contents." The Time-Zone header will determine the timezone used for generating that current timestamp.
Using the last known timezone for the user
If no Time-Zone header is specified and you make an authenticated call to the API, we use the last known timezone for the authenticated user. The last known timezone is updated whenever you browse the GitHub website.
Defaulting to UTC without other timezone information
If the steps above don't result in any information, we use UTC as the timezone.About cross-origin requests
A cross-origin request is a request made to a different domain than the one originating the request. For security reasons, most web browsers block cross-origin requests. However, you can use cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and JSONP callbacks to make cross-origin requests.
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
The REST API supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. For more information, see the "CORS W3C Recommendation" and the HTML 5 Security Guide
Here's a sample request sent from a browser hitting
http://example.com:
$ curl -I https://api.github.com -H "Origin: http://example.com"
HTTP/2 302
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, x-ratelimit-limit, x-ratelimit-remaining, x-ratelimit-reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval

This is what the CORS preflight request looks like:
$ curl -I https://api.github.com -H "Origin: http://example.com" -X OPTIONS
HTTP/2 204
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, If-Match, If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Unmodified-Since, X-Requested-With
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, x-ratelimit-limit, x-ratelimit-remaining, x-ratelimit-reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400

JSON-P callbacks
You can send a ?callback parameter to any GET call to have the results
wrapped in a JSON function. This is typically used when browsers want to embed GitHub content in web pages and avoid cross-domain problems. The response includes the same data output as the regular API, plus the relevant HTTP Header information.
$ curl https://api.github.com?callback=foo

> /**/foo({
>   "meta": {
>     "status": 200,
>     "x-ratelimit-limit": "5000",
>     "x-ratelimit-remaining": "4966",
>     "x-ratelimit-reset": "1372700873",
>     "Link": [ // pagination headers and other links
>       ["https://api.github.com?page=2", {"rel": "next"}]
>     ]
>   },
>   "data": {
>     // the data
>   }
> })

You can write a JavaScript handler to process the callback. Here's a minimal example you can try:
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function foo(response) {
  var meta = response.meta;
  var data = response.data;
  console.log(meta);
  console.log(data);
}

var script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://api.github.com?callback=foo';

document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
</script>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Open up your browser's console.</p>
</body>
</html>

All of the headers have the same string value as the HTTP Headers, except Link. Link headers are pre-parsed for you and come through as an array of [url, options] tuples.
For example, a link that looks like this:
Link: <url1>; rel="next", <url2>; rel="foo"; bar="baz"

will look like this in the Callback output:
{
  "Link": [
    [
      "url1",
      {
        "rel": "next"
      }
    ],
    [
      "url2",
      {
        "rel": "foo",
        "bar": "baz"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
Issue events are triggered by activity in issues and pull requests and are available in the REST API for Issue events and Timeline events. Each event type specifies whether the event is available in the REST API for issue events or timeline events.
GitHub's REST API considers every pull request to be an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, the Issue Events and Timeline Events endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. Pull requests have a pull_request property in the issue object. Because pull requests are issues, issue and pull request numbers do not overlap in a repository. For example, if you open your first issue in a repository, the number will be 1. If you then open a pull request, the number will be 2. Each event type specifies if the event occurs in pull request, issues, or both.
Issue event object common properties
Issue events all have the same object structure, except events that are only available in the REST API for timeline events. Some events also include additional properties that provide more context about the event resources. Refer to the specific event for details about any properties that differ from this object format.
